# **Product Requirements Document (PRD) - LLM for Battery Storage Arbitrage Optimization**

## **1. Overview**

This PRD outlines the training and deployment of a **custom Large Language Model (LLM)** to optimize battery storage arbitrage. The LLM will learn from historical market data to predict optimal charge and discharge decisions in the **Mercado ElÃ©ctrico Mayorista (MEM) de MÃ©xico**. This will replace static rule-based systems with a dynamic, continuously improving AI-driven model.

## **2. Problem Statement**

Energy arbitrage relies on charging during low-price periods and discharging during high-price periods. Traditional rule-based strategies struggle to adapt to:
- **Market Volatility**: Prices fluctuate due to congestion, demand, and external factors.
- **Hidden Arbitrage Patterns**: Simple heuristics miss profitable opportunities in complex datasets.
- **Dynamic Market Conditions**: Static algorithms do not adapt over time.

By training an **LLM on a full year of market data**, we enable **data-driven, adaptive arbitrage decisions** that continuously improve with new data.

## **3. Training Approach**

### **3.1. Data Collection**
To train the LLM, we collect **a full year of historical market data**, including:
- **Hourly Price Data**: Precio Marginal Local (**PML**) for each node.
- **Congestion Indicators**: `pml_cng` values for congestion analysis.
- **Battery Performance Data**: State of Charge (**SOC**), charge/discharge cycles.
- **Past Arbitrage Actions**: Labels for successful and unsuccessful trades.
- **External Factors** (if available): Demand, weather, grid congestion.

### **3.2. Data Preprocessing**
To prepare the dataset, we:
- **Normalize Prices & SOC**: Scale numerical values to prevent distortion.
- **Engineer Cyclical Features**: Convert timestamps into **hour-of-day, day-of-week, seasonality indicators**.
- **Label Actions**:
  - **"Charge"**: If price is historically low and expected to rise.
  - **"Discharge"**: If price is historically high and expected to fall.
  - **"Hold"**: If arbitrage conditions are not met.
- **Filter Noisy Data**: Remove erroneous values (e.g., `pml = 0`).

### **3.3. Model Selection & Training**
#### **3.3.1. Base Model Choice**
We fine-tune an existing LLM instead of training from scratch:
- **LLaMA 3 / GPT-4 / Falcon**: Pre-trained transformer models.
- **Energy Market-Specific LLM**: Fine-tuned on MEM market trends.
- **Custom Transformer Model** (if needed for specialized architecture).

#### **3.3.2. Fine-Tuning Process**
1. **Supervised Learning**: Train the model on historical **price + SOC + arbitrage action pairs**.
2. **Reinforcement Learning (RLHF)**: Improve decision-making using **reward functions** based on successful arbitrage outcomes.
3. **Few-Shot Learning**: Provide high-quality examples of **successful arbitrage trades** to guide model behavior.

#### **3.3.3. Training Objectives**
- **Loss Function**: Minimize prediction errors in arbitrage action selection.
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - **Accuracy of Charge/Discharge Predictions** (vs. actual profitable trades).
  - **Profitability Improvement Over Time** (measured against baseline rule-based strategies).
  - **Battery Efficiency** (Avoid unnecessary charge/discharge cycles).

### **3.4. Backtesting & Validation**
Before deploying, we test the LLM using **real historical data** to evaluate:
- **Revenue impact compared to existing rule-based algorithms**.
- **Robustness to market volatility**.
- **Generalization across different nodes & market conditions**.

## **4. Deployment Strategy**

### **4.1. Real-Time API Integration**
Once trained, the LLM is deployed as an **API service** that:
1. **Takes real-time market data as input**.
2. **Analyzes price trends, congestion, and battery state**.
3. **Predicts the best arbitrage action (`charge`, `discharge`, `hold`)**.
4. **Provides an action confidence score**.

### **4.2. Continuous Model Improvement**
The model is retrained **every month** with the latest market data to:
- **Incorporate new trading patterns**.
- **Improve prediction accuracy**.
- **Adapt to changing market conditions**.

## **5. Open Questions**
- Should we incorporate **weather forecasts and demand predictions**?
- How often should we **retrain the model** with new data?
- Should we explore **hybrid models** (LLM + traditional ML)?

## **6. Summary**
By leveraging an LLM trained on historical arbitrage data, we enable:
âœ… **Smarter, data-driven charge/discharge decisions**.
âœ… **A continuously improving arbitrage strategy**.
âœ… **Real-time predictions based on past market behaviors**.

This AI-powered optimizer will **outperform traditional rule-based models** by learning from **real market trends** instead of relying on predefined heuristics. ðŸš€
