# **Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Testing Strategy for Battery Storage Arbitrage Optimizer**

## **1. Overview**
This document defines the testing strategy for the **Battery Storage Arbitrage Optimizer**. The goal is to validate the algorithm's ability to maximize revenue while adhering to battery constraints, efficiency losses, and market conditions.

## **2. Objectives**
- Ensure the optimizer correctly identifies optimal **charge, discharge, and idle** actions.
- Validate efficiency calculations and arbitrage decision logic.
- Test performance across different **nodes, market conditions, and time frames**.
- Identify potential weaknesses or edge cases that may impact profitability.

## **3. Node Selection for Testing**
Since the optimizer must work across various nodes, we select representative nodes that capture **different market conditions**:

| Node          | Reason for Selection |
|--------------|----------------------|
| **MONTERREY** | Industrial center, high demand |
| **MERIDA**    | Stable market, low congestion |
| **PUEBLA**    | Central region, medium volatility |
| **CANCUN**    | Tourist-driven, seasonal price fluctuations |
| **OBREGON**   | Agricultural area, renewable integration |

This selection ensures the algorithm is tested in diverse market conditions.

## **4. Test Scenarios**
The optimizer will be tested under various scenarios to ensure robustness.

### **4.1. Basic Arbitrage Verification**
- Ensure charging occurs at low price hours and discharging at high price hours.
- Verify that efficiency losses are correctly accounted for in revenue calculations.

### **4.2. Price Volatility Handling**
- Test performance under rapid price fluctuations (e.g., sudden price spikes/drop-offs).
- Ensure the optimizer adapts dynamically to changing price conditions.

### **4.3. Congestion-Aware Scheduling**
- Validate the optimizer avoids charging during periods of high `pml_cng` values.
- Check if congestion-related pricing anomalies are handled correctly.

### **4.4. Battery Constraints Enforcement**
- Ensure the optimizer respects **min/max SOC** limits.
- Validate charge/discharge rate constraints.
- Confirm that partial charge/discharge cycles follow efficiency calculations correctly.

### **4.5. Different Time Periods**
- Test during **peak demand months** (e.g., summer/winter seasons with high volatility).
- Test during **low-demand periods** (e.g., rainy season with lower energy consumption).

## **5. Validation Methods**
A combination of **unit tests, backtesting, and simulation-based testing** will be used to ensure correctness and reliability.

### **5.1. Unit Testing**
- Validate individual components of the optimization logic.
- Ensure mathematical accuracy in efficiency loss calculations.

### **5.2. Historical Backtesting**
- Apply the optimizer to real historical price data from MEM.
- Compare predicted actions against theoretical best-case arbitrage.

### **5.3. Simulations with Synthetic Data**
- Generate price scenarios with controlled variations to test edge cases.
- Simulate worst-case conditions (e.g., extended periods of low arbitrage opportunities).

### **5.4. Baseline Comparison**
- Compare optimizer performance against a **simple heuristic strategy** (e.g., "Always charge at the lowest price and discharge at the highest price").
- Measure profitability differences, efficiency impact, and error rates.

## **6. Performance Metrics**
The following key metrics will be tracked:

| Metric                  | Description |
|-------------------------|-------------|
| **Total revenue**       | Sum of all profitable trades across test cases. |
| **Avg daily revenue**   | Mean revenue per day, used to assess stability. |
| **SOC compliance**      | % of time the SOC stays within min/max limits. |
| **Charge/discharge spread** | Average price difference between charge and discharge actions. |
| **Efficiency loss impact** | Measure of how much energy is lost per cycle. |

## **7. Summary**
This PRD outlines a **structured testing strategy** to ensure the Battery Storage Arbitrage Optimizer operates reliably across different market conditions. Testing will focus on **arbitrage accuracy, efficiency handling, congestion adaptation, and overall profitability**, ensuring a robust and scalable implementation. ðŸš€
