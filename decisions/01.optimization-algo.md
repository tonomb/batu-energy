# **Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Battery Storage Arbitrage Optimizer**

## **1. Overview**

This document outlines the technical specifications and decision-making process for developing an **API-driven Battery Storage Arbitrage Optimizer**. The system determines optimal charging and discharging schedules to **maximize revenue** from price arbitrage in the **Mercado Eléctrico Mayorista (MEM) de México**, while respecting battery constraints and efficiency losses.

## **2. Problem Statement**

Energy storage systems can exploit fluctuations in nodal electricity prices (**PML - Precio Marginal Local**) by charging when prices are low and discharging when prices are high. However, maximizing arbitrage profit requires accounting for:

- **Battery Constraints** (capacity, charge/discharge rates, SOC limits, and efficiency losses).
- **Market Conditions** (volatility, congestion pricing, and historical trends).
- **Optimization Logic** that balances profit maximization against operational constraints.

## **4. Technical Decisions & Assumptions**

### **4.1. Pricing Data Considerations**

- We use **PML (Precio Marginal Local) as the primary price indicator**.
- PML consists of three components:
  - `pml_ene` (Energy Component) ✅ Used to determine base pricing trends.
  - `pml_cng` (Congestion Component) ⚠️ Used to avoid charging in high congestion periods.
  - `pml_per` (Losses Component) ⚠️ Considered if losses significantly impact profitability.
- **Final decision:** Use `pml` (total price) but avoid periods with unusually high `pml_cng` values.

### **4.2. Arbitrage Decision Logic**

- **Charge** when the **expected future price spread exceeds an efficiency-adjusted threshold**.
  - Minimum profitable discharge price:

    $$
    P_{discharge} > P_{charge} \times \frac{1}{\eta_{charge} \times \eta_{discharge}}
    $$

  - Given a **round-trip efficiency of 85%** (**92.2% per step**), the breakeven price is:

    $$
    P_{discharge} > P_{charge} \times 1.18
    $$

- **Discharge** when future price > 118% of charge price.
- **Idle** when arbitrage spread is insufficient to cover efficiency losses.
- **Rounded numerical calculations** ensure **precise energy values** and avoid floating point errors.

### **4.3. Optimization Time Window**

- Instead of a fixed **7-14 day rolling average**, we implement an **adaptive lookback period**: // This did not work as expected, so we use a single next-hour price instead of adaptive lookback
  - **Stable Nodes (low volatility)**: 14-30 day moving average.
  - **Volatile Nodes (high price fluctuation)**: 3-7 day moving average.
- **Price volatility dynamically determines the lookback period.**

### **4.4. Battery Constraints & Modeling**

- **Capacity (`capacity_mw`, `duration_hours`)** → Defines MWh storage limits.
- **State of Charge (`SOC`) Constraints:**
  - Min SOC (`min_soc`) = e.g., 10% (to prevent depletion risk).
  - Max SOC (`max_soc`) = 100% (to prevent overcharging).
- **Charge/Discharge Limits:**
  - Charging rate cannot exceed `capacity_mw` per hour.
  - Efficiency loss is applied **incrementally per cycle** (92.2% per step).

### **4.5. Handling Zero or Anomalous PML Values**

- If `pml = 0`, assume missing data and interpolate using prior values.
- If `pml_cng` > threshold, avoid charging due to congestion spikes.

### **4.6. Backtesting & Evaluation**

- The optimizer is **backtested using historical data** from the MEM market.
- Evaluation metrics:
  - **Total revenue generated** per node and per week.
  - **Cycle efficiency** (MWh charged vs. MWh discharged).
  - **Best and worst trading days** for price arbitrage.
  - **Sensitivity analysis** to adjust charge/discharge thresholds.

## **5. Implementation Plan**

### **5.1. Development Stack**

- **Backend:** Node.js (TypeScript) with AWS Lambda functions.
- **Data Processing:** Using `math.js` for precision.
- **Infrastructure:**
  - API Gateway → Expose the `POST /optimize` endpoint.
  - AWS Lambda → Compute optimal schedules.
  - Terraform → Infrastructure as Code (manual deployments for MVP).

## **6. Open Questions**

- Should we incorporate **real-time forecasting models** to anticipate price spikes?
- Do we want to introduce **dynamic charge/discharge power scaling** instead of binary (all-or-nothing) charging decisions?
- Would integrating **multi-node arbitrage optimization** be beneficial in the future?

## **7. Summary**

This PRD details the **Battery Storage Arbitrage Optimizer**, focusing on **data-driven, efficiency-aware** optimization of charge/discharge decisions. We account for:

- **Split-step efficiency losses** (92.2% per step, 85% round-trip).
- **Dynamic rolling window selection** based on price volatility.
- **PML component analysis** to avoid congestion-heavy hours.
- **Real-world backtesting to validate profit potential.**

By implementing the above logic, we ensure a **robust, adaptable arbitrage strategy** that maximizes storage profitability. 🚀
